  ## Description 
  In this project I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. 

  Social Network API application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps.

  ## Installation
  To run this application you will need to install the following packages;
  - [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
  - [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
  - [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

  This application also uses [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test API's and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to analyze and see MongoDB data.
